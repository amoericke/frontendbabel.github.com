## About Frontend Babel

The world is diverse. We frontend developers work in different companies, live on different continents, look different and act different, yet we have something in common: **the passion**. Passion for discovering new, sharing what we already know, and reaching out for impossible.

Because of the Internet, we do not feel separated by continents or distances. We learned to embrace different cultures, think across borders and boundaries. 

Many frontend developers and web enthusiasts around the globe write articles, blog posts, share important information in different languages. Using English as a lingua franca, we probably underestimate the amount of information we cannot access — because of the language boundaries, as old as [the Tower of Babel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel). Our comminuty deserves better and can do better, in the modern world where people help each other and collaborate like never before.

That's why we decided to start Frontend Babel — a project for publishing amateur English translations of frontend articles originally written in other languages. Not all authors have time or resources or skills to make an English version of what they write on the Internet. Other people from the community can change that, contributing their translations and helping the world discover new frontend stars, experts, and innovators. Across boundaries.

## How To Help

We are a community project, that means you can join us if you want. We are looking for people with bilingual or professional proficiency in English who want to translate frontend-related materials, articles, and publications from non-English languages.

We are not strict with requirements. However, we only publish materials that were never translated to English before, and topic should be frontend-oriented, i.e. HTML/CSS/JavaScript and UX are specifically welcome. Other relevant technologies can be considered, too. For each translator, our web site will be glad to publish a short summary of what she or he does, along with some links or promos.

It's a good idea to notify the original author about your translation plans and make sure you do not infringe any copyrights. We respect the law.

Contact us if you're interested, and let's rock!
